Monte Carlo radiative transfer, at Warp speed!
==============================================

pinball-rt is a modern Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, designed to run on GPUs and to leverage Machine Learning to accelerate the radiative transfer calculations.

Quickstart
----------

Install pinball-rt with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/psheehan/pinball-rt.git

Then set up a model and run:

.. code-block:: python

   from pinballrt.sources import Star
   from pinballrt.grids import UniformCartesianGrid
   from pinballrt.model import Model
   import astropy.units as u
   import numpy as np

   # Set up the star.
   star = Star()
   star.set_blackbody_spectrum()

   # Set up the grid.
   model = Model(grid=UniformCartesianGrid, grid_kwargs={"ncells":9, "dx":2.0*u.au})

   density = np.ones(model.grid.shape)*1.0e-16 * u.g / u.cm**3

   model.add_density(density, "yso.dst")
   model.add_star(star)

   model.thermal_mc(nphotons=1000000)
